# Spatial_regression
Estimation of a predict model to allocate resources for non operational emergencies in Ecopetrol taking into account risk and changes in temperature and precipitation with an application of spatial regression. The estimate was based on geostatistical studies for rainfall emergencies in Nigeria and on the Institute of Development Studies' compilation work for the UK government on predictive models in humanitarian actions. An important variable used in this model was the Climate Change Risk Index. 

The Climate Change Risk Index, an analysis carried out by IDEAM and UNDP in 2017, is composed of 3 components of threat, sensitivity and adaptive capacity based on 113 indicators for 6 territorial dimensions corresponding to food security, water resources, biodiversity and ecosystem services, health, human habitat and infrastructure.


Apart from the index, the data includes people benefited, resources invested, average temperature and precipitation.
